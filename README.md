# Zazi OpenBanking Platform (Community Edition)

Zazi is a minimalistic open-source core/open banking platform, built for developers, for digital SACCOs and FinTech startups. Automate all your payment needs with our simple to use API.

## Quick start

Join the [Zazi Users Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/zaziusers/shared_invite/enQtOTY0MzU5NjAwMDY3LTc2MWQ0OTZlNjhkODk3ZDI3NDVjMDE1YjgxY2I4ZjI4MzJhZmVmNjJkN2NmMGJmMzc2N2U3Yjc3ZjI5NGFlZDQ) if you need help, want to chat, or are thinking of a new feature idea.

## Philosophy

Many startups/engineers find it painful to create the backend technology around their payment wallets/gateways in a way it can communicate to Bankers/Financial Analysts as it requires deep banking domain knowledge.

We see this as a niche market to help reach their targets.

Zazi gives you full control over all your users' data, while letting anyone easily perform powerful analytics.

## Why ZAZI?

Zazi is the only <strong>product-focused</strong> open source core banking platform, with a strong focus on Kenyan Payment platforms.
