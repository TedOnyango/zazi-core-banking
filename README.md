# Zazi OpenBanking Platform (Community Edition)

Zazi is a minimalistic open-source core/open banking platform, built for developers, for digital SACCOs and FinTech startups. Automate all your M-Pesa payment needs with our simple to use API.

## Philosophy

Many startups/engineers find it painful to create the backend technology around their payment wallets/gateways in a way it can communicate to Bankers/Financial Analysts as it requires deep banking domain knowledge.

We see this as a niche market to help reach their targets.

Zazi gives you full control over all your users' data, while letting anyone easily perform powerful analytics.

It can be used as a:
1. Mpesa Loans backend (Disbursal & Repayment)
2. Mpesa Proxy
3. Digital cash management

Features we want to add:
1. User management
2. API Management UI
3. Financial Reports; {Balance Sheet, PL Statement, General/Loan Journal}
4. Complete the loan lifecycle
5. Savings Product

We are aware that alternatives exists; Mojaloop(https://mojaloop.io/), Mifos(https://mifos.org/), Mambu(http://mambu.com/) etc., but most of the alternatives are either too complicated, expensive or do not solve a minimalist's need.


## Why ZAZI?

Zazi is the only <strong>product-focused</strong> open source core banking platform, with a strong focus on M-Pesa.


## Development
